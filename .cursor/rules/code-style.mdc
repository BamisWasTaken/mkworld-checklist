# Code Style Guidelines

## TypeScript/Angular Conventions
- Use standalone components
- Follow Angular's style guide
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper error handling
- Use Angular's built-in features (pipes, directives)
- **All user-facing strings must use ngx-translate for internationalization. Do not use hardcoded strings in templates or components.**
- **Use the inject() function for dependency injection instead of constructor injection (as recommended by Angular).**
- **Prefer using Angular signals for state management and reactivity.**
- **Use the new Angular control flow syntax (e.g., @for, @if) instead of legacy structural directives like *ngFor and *ngIf.**

## File Organization
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Group related files together
- Use consistent file naming
- Keep files maintainable and focused

## Testing
- Write unit tests for components
- Use Angular's testing utilities
- Follow testing best practices
- Maintain good test coverage

## Performance
- Use lazy loading for routes
- Implement proper change detection
- Optimize bundle size
- Follow Angular performance best practices
