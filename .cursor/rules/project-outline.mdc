# Mario Kart World Checklist Application

## Project Overview
A single-page application to help players track their progress in Mario Kart World by managing sticker collection and related tasks. Initial development will focus on desktop experience with placeholder assets.

## Core Features

- Game-style title
- Brief instructions for using the sticker album
- Progress display:
  - Progress bar

### 2. Sticker Album
- Grid layout: 4 rows Ã— 8 columns per page (32 stickers per page)
- All stickers are shown (collected and uncollected)
- Collected stickers: colored or grayscale (as in-game)
- Uncollected stickers: slightly faded, become full color and slightly larger on hover
- Every sticker has a clickable checkbox/circle in the top-right corner (always visible) to mark as collected/uncollected
- No exclamation icons
- Task bar always visible below the album, shows the description of the currently hovered sticker (or a default message if none is hovered)
- Pagination:
  - Number of pages is dynamic: `Math.ceil(totalStickers / 32)`
  - Dots below the task bar indicate the current page
  - Yellow arrow buttons on left/right for navigation (no "R" letter)
  - No left arrow on the first page, no right arrow on the last page
  - Drag-to-scroll navigation (left/right only)
- No sort or X button
